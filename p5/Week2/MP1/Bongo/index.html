    This is Bongo! Bongo is a weird creature that has not been documented yet, but looks like a boxy kangaroo.
    Bongo likes to run around his weird flat wasteland and kick the air for no real reason.
    He is a very happy creature and his favorite activity is sleeping.
    Bongoâ€™s greatest dream is to not be made of sharp shapes so he can hug his friends without hurting them.
